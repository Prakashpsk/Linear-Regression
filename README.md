# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression: Insights from Car Dekho's Sales Data


![](https://github.com/Prakashpsk/Linear-Regression/blob/main/Simple%2BLinear%2BRegression.jpg)


## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars using linear regression based on features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of previous owners. Insights derived from this analysis can help **CarDekho optimize pricing strategies** and improve **customer satisfaction**.

## Skills/Concepts Developed
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Multiple linear regression modeling
- Feature importance analysis
- Diagnostic plot visualization

## Problem Statement
**CarDekho aims to predict the selling price of cars accurately** to provide customers with fair pricing and optimize business profitability. By building a linear regression model, the company can leverage **historical sales data to predict future car prices**.

## Modeling
### Steps
1. **Read the cars dataset**.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess data quality and handle missing values.
3. **Transform categorical data into numerical format** for modeling.
4. Apply **multiple linear regression model** to predict selling price.
5. Print model results and assess performance metrics.
6. Evaluate **feature importance** to understand the impact of different variables on selling price.
7. Visualize **diagnostic plots** to validate model assumptions.

## Visualization
Visualizations such as scatter plots, regression plots, and residual plots are utilized to assess the relationship between predictor variables and the target variable (selling price) and to diagnose model performance.

## Conclusion
By leveraging multiple linear regression, CarDekho can accurately predict car prices based on various features. The model's **high R-squared and adjusted R-squared values** demonstrate its effectiveness in explaining the variance in selling prices.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, CarDekho can optimize pricing strategies, identify influential features affecting car prices, and tailor marketing efforts to **target specific customer segments**.

## How to Use
Users can access the code repository on GitHub to replicate the analysis and apply the linear regression model to their own car sales data. **Detailed instructions** are provided for running the code and interpreting the results.
